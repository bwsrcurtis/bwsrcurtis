# Hi there 👋
## 🚀 About Me
🎓 I am Curtis Bowser, a **Software Developer**, with a bachelor's degree in **Economics**.

🌱 I enjoy working consistently on new projects and learning new technologies. Recently I have been working on my skills in **Django** and **Flask**, along with getting better in **JavaScript**. The first language I learned was **Python**. I am currently working to break into the field.

📚 Outside the world of tech, I enjoy reading. Some of my favorites are **Frankenstein** by _Mary Shelley_ and **The Picture of Dorian Gray** by _Oscar Wilde_. I think there is little that broadens your mind like getting lost in a book.
