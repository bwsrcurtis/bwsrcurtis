# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## ðŸš€ About Me



ðŸŽ“ I am Curtis Bowser, a **Web Developer**, with a bachelor's degree in **Economics**.

ðŸŒ± I enjoy working consistently on new projects and learning new technologies. Recently I have been working in **React**, along with improving in **JavaScript**. The first language I learned was **Python**. 

ðŸ“š Outside the world of tech, I enjoy reading. Some of my favorites are **Frankenstein** by _Mary Shelley_ and **The Picture of Dorian Gray** by _Oscar Wilde_. I think there is little that broadens your mind like getting lost in a book.
